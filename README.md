# SimpleBankingSystem
The code implements a simple banking system that allows users to perform basic operations such as withdrawing money, depositing funds, and checking their account balance. It uses a Bank class to manage customer data, verify card information, and provide a menu-driven interface for banking services. Users interact with the system by entering their card number and CVV to access their accounts.
